# Reflection

## Documentation

### Main Concepts Applied
- **React**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Zustand**: Implemented for state management to handle todos efficiently.
- **Vite**: Configured for fast development and optimized builds.
- **ESLint**: Integrated for maintaining code quality and consistency.

## Reflection

### What I Learned
- How to use Zustand for managing application state in a React project.
- Setting up a development environment with Vite for faster builds.
- Configuring ESLint to enforce coding standards.

### Challenges Faced
1. **State Management**:
   - Initially struggled with understanding Zustand's API.
   - Resolved by referring to the official documentation and examples.

2. **ESLint Configuration**:
   - Encountered issues with ESLint rules conflicting with React hooks.
   - Fixed by adding the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin.

### Screenshots
- Below is an example of the error encountered with React hooks:
  ![React Hooks Error](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=React+Hooks+Error)
- After resolving the issue:
  ![Resolved Error](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Resolved+Error)
