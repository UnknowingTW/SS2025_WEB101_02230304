### What I Learned
- How to set up a React project with Vite for faster development.
- Configuring ESLint to ensure consistent coding standards.
- Building a responsive and dynamic user interface.

### Challenges Faced
1. **React State Management**:
   - Initially struggled with managing component states effectively.
   - Resolved by using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

2. **ESLint Configuration**:
   - Encountered issues with ESLint rules conflicting with React hooks.
   - Fixed by adding the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin.
